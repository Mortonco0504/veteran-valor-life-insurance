                    <h4>Understanding No Medical Exam Life Insurance</h4>
                    <p>No medical exam life insurance eliminates the traditional medical underwriting process, making it ideal for veterans who:</p>

                    <h5>How No Medical Exam Insurance Works</h5>

                        <li><strong>Health Questions</strong>: Basic health questionnaires instead of medical exams</li>

                    </ul>
